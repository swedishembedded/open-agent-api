  summary: Interact with an agent (chat interface)
  description: |
    Send a chat conversation to the specified agent and get a response. Supports streaming responses via SSE.
    The agent can utilize tools if available; tool requests will be surfaced as events in streaming mode.
    If not streaming, the agent's final answer is returned directly.

              Server-Sent Events stream. The stream will contain events:
              - RunStartedEvent (agent started processing)
              - ToolCallStartedEvent (tool started processing)
              - RunResponseEvent (partial output or tool request)
              - RunCompletedEvent (final output)
              - ToolCallCompletedEvent (tool completed)
              Each event's data is a JSON object with at least a "type" field and additional fields depending on type.
              For example, a ToolRequest event may have { "type": "ToolRequest", "tool": "...", "input": "..." }.
